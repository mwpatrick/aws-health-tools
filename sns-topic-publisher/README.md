## AWS Health Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) Topic Publisher

### Description
This tool can be used to send custom notifications to a SNS topic when an AWS Health event happens by using AWS Lambda and Amazon CloudWatch Events. SNS topic subscribers (for example, web servers, email addresses, Amazon SQS queues, or AWS Lambda functions) can consume or receive the message or notification over one of the supported protocols (Amazon SQS, HTTP/S, email, SMS, Lambda) when they are subscribed to the topic. More information about SNS is available here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html

### Setup and Usage

#### Setup using CloudFormation 

Choose **Launch Stack** to launch the AWS Health SNS Topic Publisher template in the US East (N. Virginia) Region in your account:
 
<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=AWSHealthSNSTopicPublisher&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-health-tools/Cloudformation-templates/sns-topic-publisher.json" title="Launch Stack"><img src="../images/cloudformation-launch-stack.png" alt="Launch Stack" /></a>

Please update the region and the SNS topic name according to your requirements.

#### Manual setup

1. Create an IAM role for the Lambda function to use. Attach the [IAM policy](IAMPolicy) to the role in the IAM console.
Documentation on how to create an IAM policy is available here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html
Documentation on how to create an IAM role for Lambda is available here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html#roles-creatingrole-service-console

2. Create a Lambda JavaScript function by using the [sample](LambdaFunction.js) provided and choose the IAM role created in step 1. Update the configuration section of the script with the SNS topic ARN.
More information about Lambda is available here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html

3. Create a CloudWatch Events rule to trigger the Lambda function created in step 2 for AWS Health events.
Documentation on how to create AWS Health CloudWatch Events rules is available here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html

More information about AWS Health is available here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html

Note that this is a just an example of how to set up automation with AWS Health, Amazon CloudWatch Events, and AWS Lambda. We recommend testing the example and tailoring it to your environment before using it in your production environment.
